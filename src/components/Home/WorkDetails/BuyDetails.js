          Understanding all of the steps is a great way to begin From finding
          the right agent to getting your keys, learn the basics of how to buy a
          home.
        </p>
        <span>Step 1: Determine your budget</span>
        <p>
          Even before you start searching, you should determine how much you can
          afford with an online tool like the Redfin Home Affordability
          Calculator. Just plug in some basic information to get an estimate of
          how much you can spend on a home.
        </p>
        <h6>Save up for a down payment</h6>
        <p>
          A big part of your mortgage will be determined based on how much you
          pay upfront in the form of a down payment. Generally, the higher the
          down payment, the better the interest rate will be. If you decide to
          put down less than 20%, you’ll likely need to pay private mortgage
          insurance (PMI). Speak with your agent and lender to understand your
          options and determine the best down payment for you.
        </p>
        <h6>Don’t forget about closing costs</h6>
        <p>
          Closing costs are fees paid at closing and usually total 2%–5% of the
          final sale price. Read more about closing costs for buyers below, in
          Step 6.
        </p>
        <span>Step 2: Get pre-approved for a mortgage</span>
        <p>
          Sellers are typically more willing to accept offers from pre-approved
          buyers, because it shows that the buyer has the financial resources
          available to make good on their offer. Get quotes from multiple
          lenders and go with someone reliable. Read online reviews of each
          lender and consider their responsiveness, transparency, and estimated
          closing timeline. To get started, see which lenders Redfin clients
          recommend here, or ask a Redfin Agent who she or he trusts in your
          area.
        </p>
        <h6>Apply for pre-approval</h6>
        <p>
          Once you select a lender, apply for pre-approval. Your lender will
          check your credit and ask for all of your financial documents—tax
          returns, pay stubs, bank statements, credit card statements, student
          and auto loans, etc.—to accurately assess your financial situation.
          Keep in mind that just because you’re pre-approved for a certain
          amount doesn’t mean you can actually afford that amount. Prepare your
          own monthly budget to figure out what you’ll be comfortable paying.
        </p>
        <span>Step 3: Find a buyer’s agent</span>
        <p>
          Real estate agents are licensed professionals who have access to
          information that isn’t open to the public. A good buyer’s agent will
          be an expert on the home buying process, know your area inside and
          out, be familiar with local listing agents, and be a skilled
          negotiator. The seller pays all real estate commissions in a home
          sale, so working with a great real estate agent won’t cost you a
          thing.
        </p>
        <h6>Avoid dual agency</h6>
        <p>
          Dual agency occurs when the listing agent selling a home also serves
          as the buyer’s agent. Would you go to court and elect to use the
          opposing client’s lawyer? Probably not, and it is the same in real
          estate. That’s why Redfin does not allow dual agency within our
          brokerage. To be clear, two Redfin Agents can and do represent buyers
          and sellers in the same transaction, but just not one individual
          agent. We recommend that buyers have their own representation to
          ensure their best interests are being met.
        </p>
        <h6>Self-representation</h6>
        <p>
          If you’re considering representing yourself without an agent, you may
          be at a disadvantage, especially in a competitive market. Most
          experienced listing agents strongly prefer buyers who have agent
          representation because it is the best protection for all parties
          involved: the agents, the buyer, and the seller.
        </p>
        <span>Step 4: Start looking at homes</span>
        <p>
          Once you’re pre-approved and have an agent, you’re ready to look for a
          home.
        </p>
        <h6>Narrow down your search</h6>
        <p>
          If you’re like most homebuyers, you’re browsing homes for sale day and
          night on Redfin.com. At this point, it’s a good idea to narrow down
          your search. Determine your ideal neighborhoods, and make a list of
          must-haves vs. nice-to-haves. If you’re having a tough time narrowing
          down, speak with your real estate agent about what she or he thinks is
          realistic for your price range. Learn how to enter your criteria and
          save searches on Redfin.com so you’ll never miss a home.
        </p>
        <h6>Tour, tour, tour!</h6>
        <p>
          How long does it take to buy a house? Take as much time and tour as
          many homes as you need to find the right one. Book a tour instantly
          online with a local Redfin Agent or contact your real estate agent to
          set up a tour. Also check for weekly open houses, which typically take
          place on Saturday and Sunday, between 10 am and 4 pm. When you work
          with Redfin, you can tour as many homes as you want, whenever you
          want.
        </p>
        <h6>Finding open houses on Redfin</h6>
        <p>
          Whenever you run a search for homes, we'll automatically label any
          upcoming open houses with the word “OPEN” above the home icons on the
          map. You can also change your search criteria to include only open
          houses: Click “More Filters” near the top of the page. Select “Open
          Houses” under “Include Only” in the drop-down menu. Run your new
          search. Only homes with upcoming open houses will be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow common courtesy but don’t be shy when touring. Inspect each
          home carefully and note details like how strong the water pressure is,
          how much street noise you hear, etc. It’s easy to get homes mixed up
          so take photos and take notes for each home.
        </p>
        <span>Step 5: Make an offer</span>
        <p>
          Some sellers will have an offer-review date, while others will be open
          to any offers that come in. Make sure you ask your agent about this
          for each home you’re interested in. When you’re ready, your agent will
          help you determine how much to offer and which contingencies to
          include. To determine your initial offer price, check to see if the
          home has a Redfin Estimate, and ask your agent for a comparative
          market analysis (CMA). A CMA will show the list and final sale prices
          for similar homes that recently sold in that area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you submit your offer, the seller will review it with their agent
          and accept, decline, or submit a counteroffer. If your offer is
          rejected, make sure your real estate agent explains why so you can
          learn from each offer.
        </p>
        <h6>Negotiate if needed</h6>
        <p>
          Counter-offers are common and should even be expected. If you end up
          in a counter-offer situation, your agent will help you negotiate the
          best deal possible. When negotiating, don’t focus only on your final
          offer price. Instead, look at the whole picture and consider raising
          your earnest money, waiving contingencies, or proposing an earlier
          closing date
        </p>
        <span>Step 6: Close</span>
        <p>
          Once you and the seller agree on the terms, you’ll enter the closing
          process, or escrow, which usually takes 30 to 45 days. You’ll likely
          be in very close communication with your agent, lender, and escrow
          agency during this time.
        </p>
        <h6>Closing costs for buyers</h6>
        <p>
          Closing costs are the lender and third-party fees paid at the close of
          a real estate transaction. The fees usually total 2%–5% of the final
          sale price. You can learn more about the costs that you’ll pay at
          closing, and ways to lower them, on our resources page. In addition to
          closing costs, your lender may require that you have at least two to
          six monthly payments (including principal, interest, taxes, and
          insurance) in the bank after the closing
        </p>
        <h6>Final steps in closing</h6>
        <p>
          Once you enter escrow, you’ll have deadlines to complete each of the
          following: Make your earnest money deposit Order your title If you
          have a contingency, get a home inspection and request repairs Work
          with your lender to finalize your loan Have your home professionally
          appraised Get homeowner’s insurance Coordinate all of your paperwork
          with an underwriter Do a final walk-through Submit a cashier's check
          for your down payment and closing costs Close escrow and sign all
          required paperwork If all goes well, your contingencies will be
          removed and your bank will get the money to the seller on time for a
          smooth closing. smooth closing.
        </p>
        <span>Step 7: Get the keys and move</span>
        <p>
          Welcome to your new home! You will typically get the keys after 5 pm
          on your close date.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether or not your home is turnkey ready, there might be some
          maintenance and remodeling you want to complete before moving in.
          You’ll also want to think about hiring movers, buying new furniture
          and appliances, setting up your utilities, etc. You’ll pay for these
          after the home is yours but may want to factor them into your
          home-buying budget or create a separate post-move budget. If you buy
          with a Redfin Agent, you’ll have access to exclusive offers on
          everything from movers to home security through the Redfin
          Marketplace.
